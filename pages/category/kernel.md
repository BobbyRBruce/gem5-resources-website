# Kernel

Kernels are computer programs that act as the core of an operating system, managing system resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, and providing an interface between hardware and software.

Kernels play a crucial role in full system simulation by providing the core functionality of an operating system and managing system resources. By simulating kernels, full system simulation can provide valuable insights into system behavior, performance, and optimization.
