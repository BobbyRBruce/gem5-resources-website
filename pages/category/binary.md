# Binary

A binary is a computer file that contains machine code instructions that can be executed by a computer's CPU. Binary files are typically used to distribute executable programs and libraries. 

Binary files are produced by compilers that translate high-level programming languages into machine code. The resulting binary file can then be executed on a compatible CPU architecture.
