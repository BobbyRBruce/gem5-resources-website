# Bootloader

A bootloader is a small program that is responsible for loading the operating system into memory when a computer starts up. It is typically stored in the computer's firmware, and its primary function is to initialize the system hardware, perform basic checks, and load the kernel into memory.

In computer architecture simulation, understanding how the bootloader interacts with the hardware and firmware can help identify potential issues that may arise during system startup and can inform development efforts to improve system stability and security.
